Wattiviisari is a small and simple Wear OS app for accessing the Finnish electricity spot prices on a smartwatch.
The app knows no special tricks - it just makes the price information easily available. Perhaps the most notable "feature" is the watch complication that always shows the current price.

The app gets the pricing data from two different sources. The primary source is the [ENTSO-E transparency platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/). An alternative source is the [Elering.ee API](https://dashboard.elering.ee/assets/api-doc.html).

## My projects

### [**wden**](https://github.com/luryus/wden)

A password manager TUI for Bitwarden-compatible servers. A lot more lighterweight than official Bitwarden client apps. Written in Rust using the [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) framework.

### Raspberry Pi Pico Macropad

I built a Raspberry Pi Pico based macropad for my own use. It has a completely [custom firmware](https://github.com/luryus/pico-macropad) that handles the keyboard, rotary encoders, the user interface, and USB communication with the host. It works together with a [Python-based server program](https://github.com/luryus/macropadd) that handles application-specific shortcuts and macros.
